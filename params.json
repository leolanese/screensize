{"name":"Screensize widthDetector","tagline":"screen size detector","body":"### screen size issue:\r\nWhen we are connecting to the server, the server doesn't know about the device we are using, on a Responsive project it is very important to deliver the RWD Media optimised for different devices. How to solve this problem?\r\n\r\n### DEMO (Resize to play )\r\nhttp://leolanese.com/widthdetector/\r\n\r\n\r\n### widthDetector is an easy way to detect the viewport size of your device:\r\nwidthDetect is a simple js library to @media target your grid design.

The server needs to deliver the image depending on the RWD break points, like: [0,250] = 1 image 250px and then use it max-width:100%\r\n\r\nI already created several RWD break points, but you should have 2 or 3, like: Small, Medium and Large.\r\n\r\n### On the server side.
