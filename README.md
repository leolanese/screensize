# widthDetector

##### widthDetector is an easy way to detect the viewport size of your device

widthDetect is a simple js library to @media target your grid design.  It works cross-browser, cross-device, cross-library and is less than 1KB!


## Event listeners:
This script is fired on resize() for testing propouses and rotate() for rotation propouses.


## What else you need to do:
This is the client side.
The server needs to deliver the image depending on the RWD break points, like:
[0,250] = 1 image 250px and then use it max-width:100%

I already created several RWD break points, but you should have 2 or 3, like: Small, Medium and Large.
